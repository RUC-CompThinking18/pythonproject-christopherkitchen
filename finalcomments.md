# Comments
You had lots of line-by-line comments throughout which gave good context for what individual bits of the code did. I would have liked to have seen much more robust comments to begin classes and functions to better document their arguments and return values (especially types of these things) and piece in the overall program.

# Code Quality
You did well at encapsulating the questions as a class that was reusable rather than typing that code over and over. It's not clear to me that the run_timer function is doing exactly what you want it to do since I never actually got the game over message.

As far as running the program, the interaction was good, but I would have liked to have seen more context for things like the numbers that were getting printed to the terminal. And, as I said above, I never actually managed to get the game over screen.

# Ambition
I really like the ideas behind this project and think it could be significantly expanded. I would have liked a bit more of a robust README to talk a little more about the big picture of the project, including things you might have wanted to do but weren't able to.
