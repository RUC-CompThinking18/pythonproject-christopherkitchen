Your code runs, and I think the general concept here is great. Your challenge now is to get this into a loop that can ask multiple questions. As it stands, it goes the countdown and then sticks there. Look for a way to encapsulate the question asking into a function that can be called repeatedly or use a for loop with a list of the questions so that you're not responsible for calling your ask questions method repeatedly. Also: be more descriptive with your comments! That's going to be big when it comes to your final project.
