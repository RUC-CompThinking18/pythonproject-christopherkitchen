I think I understand where this fits in with the larger scope of your project, but it's hard to be sure. The code itself makes sense and there are no obvious errors. However, the primary point of this first code review is to document your work. You need a full introductory comment on the function you wrote that explains not just what it does and why and where it fits into the larger scheme of your project. Remember that this project (and especially this first code review) isn't just about writing code but about documenting that code and the thinking behind it.
