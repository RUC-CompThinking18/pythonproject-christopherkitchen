	Studies show that climate change is a real and serious issue our planet faces. Many studies suggest that we have until 2030 to take serious action, or we may face catastrophic effects.

	There are hundreds of things the average person can do to help prevent these terrifying effects. One could walk or bike instead of drive, use less plastic, use less water, and much more.

	For my Python Project, my goal is to prompt the user with a situation — being climate change. The “game” then tells the user that there are several everyday things that could be done to help. Next, the user will notice a timer counting down; symbolic of the time our planet has left. Then, they will answer a “yes” or “no” question, and the timer will show up again.

	The code is simple, and so are the ways people can make a change.
